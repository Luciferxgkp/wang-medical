            During your first visit, you will discuss in depth your health
            concerns with Feng-Ling Wang. He will sit down and talk to you and
            together you will determine if acupuncture or Chinese Medicine is
            appropriate for you. If you decide to proceed, you will receive your
            first treatment at the same time. You will not need to reschedule to
            begin experiencing relief. Consultations are always free and you
            will never be pressured for any reason.
            <br />
            <br />
            You will receive your treatment in a clean, modern and comfortable
            treatment room. Only disposable needles and medical supplies will be
            used. You will not need to fully undress. Only the area being worked
            on will be exposed and you will be provided with draping when
            necessary.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your treatment room will be warm, quiet and relaxing. During the
            course of treatment Feng-Ling may use acupuncture, seven-star
            acupuncture (tiny needles that are used on the surface of the skin,
            but do not penetrate the skin), heat therapy, cupping therapy (a
            technique that uses suction cups on the body to relieve pain), moxa
            therapy (an herbal, heat producing treatment), acupressure or
            Chinese medical massage. Each treatment session lasts about one
            hour. You may bring a family member or friend with you during your
            treatment.
